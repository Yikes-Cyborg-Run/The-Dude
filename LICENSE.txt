# Deauth-Vader
Darth Vader images for pwnagotchi's custom faces.
There are two directories in the zip file: "50x125" and "64x64".
These are different size images to use.
Some of these are a little grainy when viewed on the pawnagotchi, but I think they're a funny addition.

I use Jayofelony's image for my pwnagotchi:

I used this video to help me get the images into the custom-faces directory, and to set up the config .toml file.

Along with these tutorials.

However, I did not need to edit the classes as instructed to do at the bottom of the page of the 2nd URL.
Everything worked just adding the files to a directory "custom-faces" in the root directory.
Then edit the config.toml file to use the images instead of the emojis.

Enjoy!
