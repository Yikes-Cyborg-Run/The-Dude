Images from the classic film "The Big Lebowski" for pwnagotchi's custom faces.  
There are two sizes: 70x125 and 56x100.  
Some of these are a little grainy when viewed on the pawnagotchi, but I think they're a funny addition.  
There are extra images in the directories, in case you want to swap out some of them.  
I also included my Photoshop document, in case you want to edit them further in Photoshop.  

I use Jayofelony's image for my pwnagotchi:

I used this video to help me get the images into the custom-faces directory, and to set up the config .toml file.

Along with these tutorials.

However, I did not need to edit the classes as instructed to do at the bottom of the page of the 2nd URL.
Everything worked just adding the files to a directory "custom-faces" in the root directory.
Then edit the config.toml file to use the images instead of the emojis.

Enjoy!
